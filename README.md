The pvlib community is looking forward to another pvlib training session at the [2023 PV Performance Modeling Workshop](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/resources-and-events/events/). During the session, you will choose a topic to explore using pvlib, and experts will be available to help you and provide guidance.

If youâ€™re new to pvlib or PV modeling, fret not, we have a several suggested projects, from Easy to Challenging. More information on each project can be found by following the links below.

The training session will take place on November 9, 2023 from 2:45 to 5 pm.
